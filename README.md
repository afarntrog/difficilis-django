## Difficilis (latin for Difficult) helps users make difficult decisions easily.
Users can enter their own dilemmas and let our software help you make a good decision. Users can also find inspiration by searching through dilemmas and conclusions shared by other users. Additionally, users can interact by sharing their dilemmas publicly and by voting on other public dilemmas. [It is not necessary to share a dilemma publicly. A user can also just use Difficilis to make a great decision and host their dilemma privately].  
Oh, did I forget to mention you do not need **any** personal info to sign up! Just a username and password; no email. You can also delete your account and/or dilemmas whenever you choose.  
More great features coming soon **!**
